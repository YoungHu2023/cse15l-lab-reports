### Part 2 - Reflection  
 The most useful thing I learnt in the second half of this quarter is Java Debugger. It provides a good way to look into the buggy part of your code and to find out where your code went wrong.  
 The other thing that really helps is the practice on bash scripts. Using Bash (or the Process class in Java) gives a very flxible way to inspect and modify a file system. It was cool.
